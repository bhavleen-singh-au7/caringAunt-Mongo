    <p>
    <p>The last few weeks have been life-changing. It took a lethal virus to change the world as we know it. Everything has come
      to a standstill. Globally, governments have implemented lockdown measures in a hope to flatten the curve, at least until
      a viable vaccine becomes imminent.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    We are living in a time of great uncertainty. There is absolutely nothing anyone of us can do but wait till things get
    better. Unfortunately, there is no specific date foreseen when things can go back to normal. We suspect that even when
    lockdown measures come to an end, we will have to adjust to a new normal – continuing to practise social distancing,
    avoiding crowded spaces, events and gatherings for a long, long time. Even if it is safe to go back to the old ways, the
    fear might still linger on for a while.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    Considering this will be the new normal for quite some time, we thought it was important to touch upon the effects this
    pandemic has had on menstruation. If you have found your periods affected in recent months, you should know you are not
    alone. Being in lockdown for a long duration can wreak havoc on your body. For one, time has no meaning. Your sleep
    schedule might be affected because with no appointments, meetings and commutes, and a possibly reduced workload, no cues
    are enabling you to wake up early. Stress and worry are also contributors to sleeping late. An irregular sleep cycle
    occurs when excess cortisol is released. Cortisol is a stress hormone released by the adrenal glands, located on top of
    the kidneys. It regulates sleep cycles, blood pressure and the release of glucose levels in the blood. Excess cortisol
    can cause a significant change in your menstrual cycle, especially when exposed to high levels of the hormone for a long
    time.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    Since everybody is different, the menstrual issues that affect each individual might differ too. Some women report
    heavier periods; others have delayed periods. Menstruators might notice a lot more spotting or heavy-duty cramps. Some
    women’s cycles have changed drastically, causing further worry over concerns of pregnancy or health issues. At this
    point, there is not much you can do in terms of the virus and the lockdown. But there are ways you can bring some
    semblance of balance to your life. Being at home means a lot of home-cooked food, so eat at regular meal time intervals,
    and eat healthily. Take up to 40 minutes to an hour every day to exercise, be it yoga, pilates or dance. Several classes
    are streaming online. Take your pick and commit to it.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    It is easy to fall into the habit of sleeping late, but you need to be strict with yourself. Commit to waking up and
    going to sleep at the same time every day. It doesn’t have to be super early, but there is no need to keep it super late
    either. Your body thrives on proper nutrition, and good health practices, and sleeping for the right amount of time, is
    most definitely a good health practice. You might find your stress getting alleviated when following a soft routine. A
    well-rested mind and body are good for your menstruation.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    We can completely relate to how scary this situation is. But at the same time, we need to be aware of what the
    ramifications of a pandemic are for people fighting on the front lines and people living in poverty. The stress for
    those on the front line must be at an all-time high. There is a shortage of adequate PPEs that doctors, nurses and
    medical personnel require for protection from the virus. They are the ones that have to treat patients of COVID-19 and
    other ailments as well. It is so nerve-wracking because the exposure is so high. Also, since the numbers of symptomatic
    patients increases by the day, their jobs become harder, and the working hours are incredibly long. Now can you imagine
    how stressful this is for a menstruator working on the front lines! The stress of being at the epicentre of the virus
    must be wreaking havoc on their bodies. To top it off, they don’t have the luxury of rest. They have to keep ploughing
    on.</p>
