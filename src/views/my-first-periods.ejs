      My First Periods

    <p>I got my first period at the age of <b>13</b>, which was quite late comparing to my friends. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I was really excited to get it and I talked about it with my schoolmates so I thought I will be prepared to finally “become a woman”. The first time was
    actually terrible. My first period was painful and woke me up at night.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I knew what was going on but I was not used to bleeding constantly for a long time so I got a bit scared. I woke up my mum and she helped me to calm down and explained
    how to wear a pad. The next day she told me for a walk and we got ice-cream. I was feeling proud and mature.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>In My City menstruation is not a taboo topic. My friends, both male and female talk about it quite openly and help each other when
    we feel weak during these days. I think it is really important to accept it the way it is and realize it is an
    absolutely natural step in every women’s life. </p>
